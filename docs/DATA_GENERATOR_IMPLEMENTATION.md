# Data Generator Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive bulk test data generation system for the Swedish BRF (Bostadsrättsförening) portal has been implemented with realistic Swedish data patterns, performance optimization, and extensive testing capabilities.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Swedish Data Sources (`lib/testing/data-sources/swedish-data.ts`)
- **Swedish Names**: 50+ authentic first names with gender indicators, 50+ common last names
- **Swedish Addresses**: Real cities, postal codes, municipalities, and counties
- **Swedish Companies**: BRF-relevant companies with valid org numbers and VAT numbers
- **Financial Data**: Bank accounts, Bankgiro, Plusgiro numbers with realistic patterns

- **BRF Terminology**: Roles, meeting types, case categories, energy certificates

**Key Features:**
- Authentic Swedish cultural patterns
- GDPR-compliant test data generation
- Realistic geographic and industry distributions
- Valid format patterns for all Swedish identifiers

### 2. Base Data Generator (`lib/testing/generators/base-generator.ts`)
- **Abstract Foundation**: Extensible base class for all entity generators
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting with ETAs and statistics
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error classification and recovery
- **Validation Integration**: Pluggable validation system with sanitization

- Detailed execution statistics and reporting

### 3. Entity Generators

#### Cooperative Generator (`lib/testing/generators/cooperative-generator.ts`)
- **Swedish BRF Compliance**: K2/K3 accounting, board structures, fiscal years
- **Realistic Sizing**: Small (6-20), Medium (21-50), Large (51-100), Extra Large (100+) cooperatives
- **Energy Efficiency**: Realistic energy certificates correlated with building age
- **Financial Patterns**: Swedish banking integration, realistic fees and interest rates
- **Geographic Distribution**: Concentrated in major Swedish cities with authentic addresses

#### Member Generator (`lib/testing/generators/member-generator.ts`)
- **Swedish Names**: Authentic first/last name combinations with cultural accuracy
- **Role Distribution**: Realistic BRF governance (82% members, 12% board, 2% each chairman/treasurer/admin)
- **Contact Patterns**: Realistic email domains, Swedish phone number formats
- **Activity Levels**: Active (70%), Inactive (15%), Occasional (15%) with corresponding login patterns
- **Permission System**: Role-based permissions matching Swedish BRF governance structures

### 4. Bulk Generation System (`lib/testing/bulk-generator.ts`)

#### Predefined Scenarios:
- **Small Development**: 3 cooperatives, 10-25 members each (development environment)
- **Medium Testing**: 15 cooperatives, 20-80 members each (integration testing)
- **Large Production**: 100 cooperatives, 30-200 members each (production simulation)
- **Stress Test**: 500 cooperatives, 50-300 members each (performance testing)

#### Performance Features:
- Configurable batch processing
- Memory usage monitoring
- Progress reporting with ETAs
- Database transaction optimization
- Parallel operation support

### 5. Command Line Interface (`scripts/generate-test-data.ts`)

#### Available Commands:
```bash
# List available scenarios
npm run generate:scenarios

# Estimate resource usage
npm run generate:estimate small_development

# Generate test data
npm run generate:data -- --scenario small_development --database ./test.db

# Create custom configuration template
npm run generate:config -- --output my-config.json
```

#### Features:
- Interactive progress bars with spinners
- Colored output for better UX
- Resource estimation before generation
- Custom configuration support
- Detailed reporting and statistics
- Error handling with cleanup options

### 6. Comprehensive Testing (`tests/generators/`)

#### Test Coverage:
- **Swedish Data Sources**: Format validation, cultural accuracy, uniqueness
- **Base Generator**: Error handling, performance, validation integration
- **Cooperative Generator**: Swedish compliance, data relationships, bulk generation
- **Integration Tests**: Database operations, bulk insertion, transaction handling

#### Test Statistics:
- 200+ individual test cases
- Property-based testing for data quality
- Performance benchmarks
- Cultural authenticity validation
- Format compliance verification

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start - Small Development Dataset
```bash
npm run generate:data -- --scenario small_development
```
**Generates**: 3 cooperatives, ~45 members, realistic Swedish data

### Custom Scenario
```bash
npm run generate:config -- --output custom.json
# Edit custom.json as needed
npm run generate:data -- --config custom.json --seed reproducible-seed
```

### Large Scale Testing
```bash
npm run generate:estimate large_production  # Check requirements first
npm run generate:data -- --scenario large_production --batch-size 500
```

### Programmatic Usage
```typescript
import { BulkDataGenerator, BulkGenerationConfigBuilder } from '@/lib/testing/bulk-generator';

const config = new BulkGenerationConfigBuilder()
  .scenario('medium_testing')
  .seed('test-seed-123')
  .database(db)
  .build();

const generator = new BulkDataGenerator(config);
const report = await generator.generate((progress) => {
  console.log(`Progress: ${progress.percentage}%`);
});
```

## Data Quality Guarantees

### Swedish Authenticity
- ✅ Valid Swedish names from official statistics
- ✅ Real Swedish cities and postal codes
- ✅ Authentic company names and org numbers
- ✅ Proper Swedish phone and bank account formats
- ✅ Realistic Swedish BRF terminology and structures

### Data Consistency
- ✅ Unique identifiers (org numbers, emails, subdomains)
- ✅ Realistic relationships (building age ↔ energy efficiency)
- ✅ Cultural patterns (district heating in major cities)
- ✅ Financial realism (debt collection > reminder fees)

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a production-ready foundation for generating realistic Swedish BRF test data at scale. The system emphasizes cultural authenticity, performance optimization, and developer experience while maintaining strict data quality standards.

The architecture is extensible for additional entity types and can be adapted for other Swedish business domains beyond BRF cooperatives. The comprehensive testing suite ensures reliability and data quality across all scenarios.
