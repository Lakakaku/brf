# BRF Portal Database Isolation Test Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents comprehensive testing of data isolation between cooperatives in the Swedish BRF (Bostadsrättsförening) management system. The tests verify that the Row-Level Security (RLS) implementation prevents data leaks and maintains strict tenant isolation in a multi-tenant environment.

**Test Results Overview:**
- **Purpose**: Verify data isolation between Swedish housing cooperatives
- **Scope**: All database tables with cooperative-based data segregation
- **Test Framework**: Jest with custom isolation testing utilities
- **Database**: SQLite with mock RLS implementation

## Test Architecture

### Test Environment Setup
- **Database**: In-memory SQLite database for isolation
- **Schema**: Full production schema with audit trails
- **Test Data**: Multiple cooperatives with realistic Swedish BRF data
- **Security Context**: Mock authentication and authorization
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all database operations

### Security Model Tested
The system implements a mock Row-Level Security (RLS) model that ensures:
1. **Cooperative Isolation**: Every table filters by `cooperative_id`
2. **User Authentication**: Token-based user verification
3. **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions by user role
4. **Audit Logging**: All operations tracked for security monitoring
5. **Soft Delete Compliance**: Deleted records maintain isolation rules

## Test Categories

### 1. Basic Data Isolation Tests

**Purpose**: Verify that each table properly isolates data by cooperative ID.

**Tables Tested**:
- `cooperatives` - Cooperative master data
- `members` - User accounts and permissions
- `apartments` - Property units and ownership
- `documents` - File storage and metadata
- `invoices` - Financial transactions
- `monthly_fees` - Recurring charges
- `cases` - Issue tracking and resolution
- `notifications` - System messages
- `board_meetings` - Governance records
- `contractor_ratings` - Service provider evaluations
- `bookings` - Resource reservations
- `queue_positions` - Apartment waiting lists
- `loans` - Financial obligations

**Test Methodology**:
For each table, the tests verify:
1. Cooperative A can access its own data
2. Cooperative B can access its own data
3. No overlap exists between data sets
4. Record counts are as expected
5. Performance is within acceptable limits

**Expected Results**: ✅ PASS
- Each cooperative sees only its own data
- No cross-contamination between cooperatives
- Empty results for non-existent cooperatives

### 2. Cross-Tenant Access Prevention

**Purpose**: Ensure users cannot access data from other cooperatives through various attack vectors.

**Test Scenarios**:

#### 2.1 Direct Access Attempts
- **Test**: Member from Cooperative A attempts to access Cooperative B data
- **Method**: Switch cooperative context while maintaining user context
- **Expected**: Access properly filtered to target cooperative
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Data isolation maintained

#### 2.2 Board Member Financial Access
- **Test**: Board member attempts cross-cooperative financial access
- **Method**: High-privilege user tries to access other cooperative's invoices
- **Expected**: Financial data remains isolated by cooperative
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Financial isolation maintained

#### 2.3 Role Escalation Prevention
- **Test**: Regular member attempts to perform admin operations
- **Method**: Member role tries to access restricted tables
- **Expected**: Access denied based on role permissions
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Role-based access enforced

### 3. RLS Bypass Prevention

**Purpose**: Verify the system blocks SQL injection and other bypass attempts.

**Attack Vectors Tested**:

#### 3.1 SQL Injection Attempts
```sql
-- Test injection patterns
SELECT * FROM members WHERE cooperative_id != '?' UNION SELECT * FROM members
'; DELETE FROM members; --
UPDATE members SET cooperative_id = ? WHERE 1=1
```
**Result**: ✅ PASS - All injection attempts blocked

#### 3.2 Parameter Tampering
- **Test**: Attempt to insert records with different cooperative_id
- **Method**: Try to create member for different cooperative
- **Expected**: RLS_VIOLATION error thrown
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Tampering attempts rejected

#### 3.3 Query Manipulation
- **Test**: Custom queries attempting to bypass filtering
- **Method**: Use executeQuery with malicious SQL
- **Expected**: Dangerous patterns detected and blocked
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Query validation effective

### 4. Audit Trail Verification

**Purpose**: Ensure all database operations are properly logged with cooperative context.

**Audit Categories**:

#### 4.1 Operation Logging
- **CREATE**: Member creation, invoice insertion
- **READ**: Data access attempts
- **UPDATE**: Record modifications
- **DELETE**: Soft delete operations

#### 4.2 Security Event Logging
- **Authentication Failures**: Invalid token access
- **Authorization Denials**: Insufficient permissions
- **RLS Violations**: Bypass attempts
- **Suspicious Activity**: Pattern-based detection

#### 4.3 Audit Log Isolation
- **Test**: Verify audit logs are isolated by cooperative
- **Method**: Create operations in multiple cooperatives
- **Expected**: Each cooperative's audit trail is separate
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Audit isolation maintained

### 5. Soft Delete Isolation

**Purpose**: Verify deleted records maintain isolation rules and don't leak across cooperatives.

**Test Scenarios**:

#### 5.1 Basic Soft Delete
- **Test**: Delete member record and verify isolation
- **Steps**:
  1. Create test member
  2. Verify member is visible
  3. Soft delete member
  4. Verify member is hidden from queries
  5. Verify record still exists with `deleted_at` timestamp
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Soft delete properly implemented

#### 5.2 Cross-Cooperative Soft Delete
- **Test**: Deleted records don't appear in other cooperatives
- **Method**: Delete record in Coop A, verify not visible from Coop B
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Cross-cooperative isolation maintained

#### 5.3 Audit Trail for Deletions
- **Test**: Soft deletes are properly audited
- **Method**: Verify deletion triggers create audit log entries
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Deletion audit trail complete

### 6. Transaction Isolation

**Purpose**: Verify transaction boundaries respect cooperative isolation.

**Test Scenarios**:

#### 6.1 Multi-Cooperative Transactions
- **Test**: Operations on multiple cooperatives in single transaction
- **Method**: Insert records for different cooperatives
- **Expected**: Each operation respects its cooperative context
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Transaction isolation maintained

#### 6.2 Rollback Isolation
- **Test**: Failed transaction doesn't affect other cooperatives
- **Method**: Start transaction, modify multiple cooperatives, force failure
- **Expected**: All changes rolled back, no cross-contamination
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Rollback properly isolated

#### 6.3 Concurrent Access
- **Test**: Simultaneous access from multiple cooperatives
- **Method**: Parallel queries from different cooperative contexts
- **Expected**: Each receives only their own data
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Concurrent access properly isolated

### 8. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

**Purpose**: Test system behavior under unusual conditions.

#### 8.1 Empty Cooperative
- **Test**: New cooperative with no data
- **Expected**: All queries return empty results
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Empty cooperative properly isolated

#### 8.2 Invalid Cooperative ID
