## Important Notes

1. **Zero-Cost First**: All agents follow the "build free, deploy when profitable" philosophy
2. **Swedish Context**: All agents understand Swedish BRF requirements and terminology

4. **Compliance**: Legal and financial agents ensure Swedish law compliance
5. **Parallel Work**: Use multiple agents simultaneously for independent tasks
